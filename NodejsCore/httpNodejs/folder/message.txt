We're launching today a public preview for the new Chrome DevTools 
Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, bringing the power of Chrome 
DevTools to AI coding assistants.

Coding agents face a fundamental problem: they are not able to see 
what the code they generate actually does when it runs in the browser. 
They're effectively programming with a blindfold on.

The Chrome DevTools MCP server changes this. AI coding assistants are 
able to debug web pages directly in Chrome, and benefit from DevTools 
debugging capabilities and performance insights. This improves their 
accuracy when identifying and fixing issues.
